# icemacs - My Ultimate Emacs Configuration!

I love Emacs...I've been hacking away at it since 2012.

---

## Configuration breakdown

I use [emacs-plus](https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus) cause it has those extra bits that make life convenient.

## Fonts

It took me forever to find the right font - Can't live without [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)

## Download

`git clone https://github.com/kenzo44/icemacs.git ~/.emacs.d`

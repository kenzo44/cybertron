I love Emacs...I've been hacking away at it since 2012. This is my ultimate configuration.

# :car: Roadmap

> Transitioning over to a module structure instead of using org mode i.e. inspired/similar to doom and crafted
> A dynamic configuration that works on all devices
> A configuration that works for all developers
> No bloat

## Prerequisites

### Emacs

I use [emacs-plus](https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus) cause it has those extra bits that make life convenient

### Font

After years of searching, [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) is perfect!

## Installation

Back up your existing configuration `~/.emacs.d/` first (if you have one):

```
mv ~/.emacs.d/ ~/.emacs.d.bak/
```

Clone icemacs

```
git clone https://github.com/kenzo44/icemacs.git ~/.emacs.d
```

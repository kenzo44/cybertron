I love Emacs...I've been hacking away at it since 2012. It has changed over the years from a single init file > multiple files > .spacemacs > doom > bwoah.org. This is my ultimate configuration!

## :car: Roadmap

* Transitioning over to a module structure instead of using org mode i.e. inspired/similar to doom and crafted
* A dynamic configuration that works on all devices
* A configuration that works for all developers
* No bloat

## :hamburger: Prerequisites

### Emacs

I use [emacs-plus](https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus) cause it has those extra bits that make life convenient

### Font

After years of searching, [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) is perfect!

## :sunglasses: Installation

Back up your existing configuration `~/.emacs.d/` first (if you have one):

```
mv ~/.emacs.d/ ~/.emacs.d.bak/
```

Clone icemacs

```
git clone https://github.com/kenzo44/icemacs.git ~/.emacs.d
```
